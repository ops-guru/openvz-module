# Ansible module for OpenVZ
YA Ansible Openvz module

## Documentation

### Summary
This module, called "openvz" will allow you to create / update / delete / start / stop OpenVZ containers. One of the primary goal is to keep the "idempotent" behavior of Ansible, using the "state" option.

More precisely :

* if state = present
    * either the VZ doesn't exists, and it's created according to the option you've entered
    * or it's already created, and it's only updated (if needed)
* if state = absent, then the VZ will be deleted
* if state = started, then the VZ will be started
* if state = stopped, then the VZ will be stopped

### Requirements

You'll need an OpenVZ kernel. It has been tested with Debian 6's OpenVZ kernel (which is a pretty old one) and OpenVZ kernel from OpenVZ repository.
You'll also need "vzctl" and "vzlist" command available.

### Options

| Name | Description | Required |
|------|-------------|----------|
| veid | This is the ID for the OpenVZ Container | yes |
| state | The state of the container you want to acheive. Choices: 'present', 'absent', started', 'stopped'. | yes |
| name | Name of the container | no |
| layout | Type of layout used to create the container. By default, it's 'simfs', but can be 'simfs'. You'll need a "new" kernel (major version > 42) to support ploop. | no | 
| hostname | Hostname of the container | no |
| diskspace | Size of the disk for the container. You can use a value in bytes or a value using units such as B, K, M, G, T or P (lowercase are also supported). You can also provide a integer value, but in this case, the value is in KiB (Kibibytes) | no |
| ostemplate | Template used to create the container. If no configuration file are provided, then OpenVZ will pick the one set by default. | no |
| config | OpenVZ configuration file used for the container. If no configuration file are provided, then OpenVZ will pick the one set by default. | no |
| ram | Size of the ram for the container. You can use a value in bytes or a value using units such as B, K, M, G, T or P (lowercase are also supported). You can also provide a integer value, but in this case, the value is in bytes. | no |
| swap | Size of the swap for the container. You can use a value in bytes or a value using units such as B, K, M, G, T or P (lowercase are also supported). You can also provide a integer value, but in this case, the value is in bytes. | no |
| ips | You can set one or several IPs in this field. You can either set the IP directly as a string, or several IPs using a list. The module will automatically add or remove IPs according to the information you'll provide. Please see the example section. This option is mutually exclusive with option veth.  | no |
| veth | Allow you to create veth interfaces on your VZ. You can set one or several veths in this field. Each veth can have multiples options, namely "mac", "host_ifname", "host_mac", and "bridge". Please see the example section. This option is mutually exclusive with option ips. | no |
| veth_ips | Allow to configure the veth IPs. Put the name of the VETH as keys. Each VETH can have up to three parameters : 'address', 'netmask' and 'gateway'. The first two are mandatory, the third is optional. The VETH mentioned in this option MUST be mentioned in the 'veth' option. If not, the module will fail ! Please note that this option updates the file "/etc/network/interfaces", therefore it's only useable for Debian and fork of Debian. Finally, there's currently NO VERIFICATION OF THE INTERFACES FILE. IT WILL BE RECREATED EACH TIME | no |
| onboot | If the container will automatically start at the boot of the hypervisor. Choices : 'on', 'yes', True, 'off', 'no', False. | no |
| nameserver | Set one or multiple nameserver on the container. You can provide either a single string as a nameserver, or a list of nameserver. Please see the example section. | no |
| searchdomain | Set one or multiple search domains on the container. You can provide either a single string as a search domain, or a list of search domains. Please see the example section. | no |

## Examples

### Create or update a container, ID 123
```YAML
- openvz:
    veid: 123
    state: present
```

### Stop a container, ID 123
```YAML
- openvz:
    veid: 123
    state: stopped
```

### Start a container, ID 123
```YAML
- openvz:
    veid: 123
    state: started
```

### Delete a container ID 123
```YAML
- openvz:
    veid: 123
    state: absent
```

### Set a single nameserver, search domain and IP on the container 123
```YAML
- openvz:
    veid: 123
    state: present
    nameserver: "172.16.0.1"
    searchdomain : "example.com"
    ips: "172.16.10.100
```

### Set multiple nameserver, search domains and IPs on the container 123
```YAML
- openvz:
    veid: 123
    state: present
    nameserver:
        - "172.16.0.1"
        - "172.16.0.2"
    searchdomain:
        - "example.com"
        - "inside.example.com"
    ips:
        - "172.16.10.100"
        - "172.16.10.101"
```

### Update a diskspace to 20 GB, ram to 2GB and swap to 500 MB
```YAML
- openvz
    veid: 123
    state: present
    diskspace: 20G
    ram: 2G
    swap: 500000000
```

### Create a container with a veth named eth0. All other veth options are left empty
```YAML
- openvz
    veid:123
    state: present
    diskspace: unlimited
    ram: 1G
    veth:
      eth0:
```
### Create a container with two veth.
The first one is named eth0 with no other options.
The second veth is called eth1, with those options :

* mac: 00:01:02:03:04:05
* host_ifname : "mainveth"
* host_mac: 00:01:02:03:04:06
* bridge : "br0"

```YAML
- openvz
    veid:123
    state: present
    diskspace: unlimited
    ram: 1G
    veth:
      eth0:
      eth1:
        mac: 00:01:02:03:04:05
        host_ifname: mainveth
        host_mac: 00:01:02:03:04:06
        bridge: br0
```
### Create a container with one veth, and the associated IP configuration for the veth.
```YAML
- openvz
    veid:123
    state: present
    diskspace: unlimited
    ram: 1G
    veth:
      eth0:
    veth_ips:
      eth0:
        address: 10.11.12.13
        netmask: 255.255.255.0
        gateway: 10.11.12.254
```

## Known issues

* If you try to delete a container that is not stopped, the module will fail.
* The configuration done using 'veth_ips' will re-create the file '/etc/network/interfaces' each time. It will NOT update
the interface configuration. This has to be done manually or by restarting the container.
